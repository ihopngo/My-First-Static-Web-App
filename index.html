		<h2>The Guy</h2>
		<p>Ernesto Miranda was arrested by Phoenix Police on March 13, 1963. Miranda was
		pointed out for the rape and kidnapping of an 18 year old. Police were pressing Miranda into
		speaking the truth. Police questioned him for two hours without informing him of 5th amendment
		right against self incrimination and his 6th amendment right to an attorney. Miranda signed a
		confession to the rape charge on a form stating that he is aware of his right of self incrimination
		even through her was never informed of it. He verbally confessed it as well. Miranda was never
		advised of his right to remain silent.</p>

		<p>At trial Miranda’s attorney argued that the confession was
		not actually voluntary because Miranda wasn’t aware of his rights. Miranda’s confession was
		used as evidence against him. He was convicted 20-30 years in Prison. Miranda appealed the
		case to the Arizona Supreme court. His defense attorney said that he was not advised of his
		right or counsel present through his questioning; his questioning should be excused at the trial.
		The Police admitted that Miranda’s rights weren’t read to him. The Court stated that Miranda
		should be aware of his rights because he convicted a crime beforehand. Miranda’s appeal was
		declined.</p>

		<p>He took it to the United States Supreme Court. The Court Ruled under the 5th
		Amendment that the police must inform suspects of their right to stay silent and the right to an
		attorney while in police custody. Defendants must be informed that they have the right to remain
		silent, that anything they say can and will be used against you in a court of law, you have a right
		to an attorney and if you cannot afford an attorney, one will be provided for you. The Court also
		stated that people can waive their rights and can confess or make a statement. The decision
		was criticized at the time for providing criminals with further means to avoid punishment.
		Miranda was retried when finding new evidence and was still sentenced to 20-30 years in
		prison. He was let out after 5 years on parole. He was killed and the killer was never found or
		caught.</p>
